# Tweeting-From-Multiple-Accounts-For-The-Same-Hashtag
This project is designed to tweet to the hashtags of Stocks (in Turkey Stock Exchange) abbreviations. 
However, by changing its design, it can be used for the desired project.

> The program initially has a nice entry with the **Welcome Screen (HOSGELDINIZ)** using QSplashScreen.

> Also,  **SeleniumWebDriver** is used to automate the tweeting process, in this project.

> There is a **Loading Screen GIF** while tweet is sending in the background.




The rest is all about designing the GUI.
